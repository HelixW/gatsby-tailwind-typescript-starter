<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## What is a Starter

This template aims to be the pure starting point for any project utilizInstallationing the same technologies. The goal of this project is to cut down on installation and setup time so that similar projects can be set up to be up and running as soon as possible.

    ```
  - **Build**: Compiles and builds static files for production

    ```
  - **Serve**: Serves the build files

<!-- MODIFICATIONS -->

## Recommended Modifications

You may not wish to use the provided features of the template, hence these are the steps to remove some of the most commonly modified parts:

- **Yarn -> NPM**: You may wish to switch to npm instead of yarn. This can be easily done by deleting the `yarn.lock` file and running
  ```sh
  npm ci
  ```
- **Use a different styleguide**: You may not wish to use the provided Airbnb Styleguide. In order to remove `airbnb` under plugins in `.eslintrc.json` and remove `eslint-config-airbnb` from project dependencies.
- **Remove Gatsby Plugins**: You may not need some of the plugins provided. To safely remove plugins, remove the plugin from `gatsby-config.js` and remove the respective plugin from the project dependencies.
